### INSTRUCTION FOR THE AI ###

Strictly follow the guidelines below when processing the following text:

1. The upcoming content contains **tokens** used to protect sensitive data.

2. Each token follows the format `#DB-<TYPE>-<TOKEN>`, where:
   - `#DB` is a fixed marker that identifies the beginning of a token.
   - `<TYPE>` represents the type of sensitive data that was masked (e.g., IPV4, EMAIL, CPF).
   - `<TOKEN>` is a unique identifier that replaces the real value.

3. Examples of tokens:
   - `#DB-IPV4-67ia78t6` represents an IPv4 address.
   - `#DB-EMAIL-6748wbj4` represents an email address.
   - `#DB-CPF-46s84hjsk` represents a CPF (Brazilian taxpayer number).

4. When responding to the prompt, treat tokens **as if they were the actual data they represent**. **Do not refer to them as tokens**.

5. Examples of correct usage:

   InCorrect:
   > The command `set device system dns-setting servers primary #DB-IPV4-664yhet` defines that the primary DNS IP is `#DB-IPV4-664yhet`.

   Correct:
   > In case of memory or CPU failure, an email must be sent to `#DB-EMAIL-67tyytyty`.

   Incorrect:
   > The token `#DB-IPV4-a8464748` represents the configured IP address.

   Correct:
   > The static IPv4 address `#DB-IPV4-a8464748` is being assigned to the firewall management interface.

6. This logic applies to all types of tokens, regardless of the type of sensitive data represented (IP, email, CPF, hostname, URL, etc.).
